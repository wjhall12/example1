    <h1>Emulation</h1>
    <h3>What is Emulation</h3>
    <img src="Emulation-1.jpg" alt="Emulation-1"><br>
    <p>Emulation is when  software is being used on non-native hardware, like emulating Android OS through your computer. The emulator is able to act similar to the original hardwear and is why many use it to emulate older consoles to play the games. Emulation is mostly used for video games because many of the old consoles like  Nintendo Entertainment System or Playstation 1 will never be released again. There are emulators that do other stuff like bluestacks which is an android emulator for windows; it allows you to play mobile games on that aren't on the system.</p>

    <h3>Why is Emulation used?</h3>
    <img src="Emulation-2.jpg" alt="Emulation-2"><br>
    <p>Many people use it to play the games that they played when they where young or games they where never able to play as a kid. They do this because many older titles will never be released on the newest platform, or they would have to by the old game console and old games on eBay, which are more expensive than games now. You could argue that it is piracy not fair to the company because you did not go out to find an old console to play the games on. But they aren't even making money off third party sales, so the only option is to wait for the company to port games to their newer console (which is very unlikely) or play it on your pc/phone/even modded hardware to play it and have a better experience. The only problem is getting the games to play.</p>

    <h3>What are Roms</h3>
    <img src="rom.jpg" alt="Roms"><br>
    <p>Rom stands for read-only memory and in the case of video game roms it is the file containing the data from, a read-only memory chip. The emulator needs many things to make the game run; you need the game in the form of a room and also the bios files which stands for basic input output system. The bios file is used for the emulator to pretend like you are on the actual hardwear and make the experinece better. Both roms and bios files can be dumped from the game and the system itself (like burning a cd) but if you don't have the game on console it will be hard to get it. This is where many people go on the internet and just download the rom of the bios file from a website, and you might think this is illegal, but it isn't.

    <h3>Piracy Laws</h3>
    <img src="piracy.jpg" alt="Piracy"><br>
    <p>Downloading a game with out paying for it might sound illegal, but in this area only sharing the roms are illegal. Even though that is illegal, there have never been any lawsuits or court cases, so the rules are not being enforeced. The rules are that, if you have the game you should be able to download a rom of it because you have paid for the game, you are just using it on another platform.</p>

    <h3>Should you Emulator your games?</h3><br>
    <img src="Gameboy.jpg" alt="GB">
    <p>Emulation is a good idea if you want to relive your childhood or experience a game you would have not been able to play but if the game is available on the companies' newest platform, it would be better to buy it from there because you are supporting them and playing it as intended.
